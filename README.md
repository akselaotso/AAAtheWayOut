# AAAtheWayOut - text adventure game

The "big project" for programming basics in Scala. The project is a text adventure game. In my game the player navigates a tower with multiple floors. To win you must fetch the key from the top floor and make your way to the bottom floor, to the exit.

The project demonstrates the ability to write relatively simple functions and more importnatly the ability to plan a project and divide the work into classes, objects and functions for the aforementioned.
